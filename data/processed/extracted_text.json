Augmented Reality (AR) is one of the emerging technologies that has been adopted in industries to aid \nusers in acquiring complex skills and carrying out many complicated tasks such product assembly and mainte­\nnance. Nevertheless, most AR applications have been developed without clear understanding of how such \ntechnology can facilitate improved learnability in terms of knowledge reusability. This paper proposed an \nenhanced AR-based training system that provides multimodal information with a contextualized information to \nimprove task comprehension and knowledge reusability compared with traditional AR that presents unimodal \nand decontextualized information. An empirical test was carried out to assess the task performance and the task \nlearnability aspects of this enhanced AR compared to the traditional AR and the paper-based document. The \nexperiment consisted of a training phase where participants carried out an electrical connection task of a sensor \nfollowed by a knowledge reuse phase where participants had to wire a second sensor using their previous \ntraining. A pre-test quiz was given before the experiment followed by the post-tests phase after the training. Post- \ntests consist of one post-test given directly after the experiment (short-term retention test) and a second post-test \nquiz given one week later (long-term retention test) to measure information retention. The results indicated that \nAR-based approaches could enhance knowledge acquisition by around 18 % for traditional AR and almost 25 % \nfor enhanced AR as compared to paper-based approach. While all training systems achieved relatively equivalent \nwell for short-term retention test, trainees who used the enhanced AR training systems statistically outperformed \nthose in the paper-based group for long term retention test. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation be­\ntween the score of short-term retention test and the score in the knowledge reusability which was also shown by \nthe higher scores in knowledge reusability for the enhanced AR training system compared to the other two \napproaches. These findings are discussed in relation to the Industry 5.0′s human centric core value.   \n1. Introduction \nThe adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies enables new capabilities to \nproduce and to deliver product faster with a better quality, and more \ncost efficient. However, this industrial revolution is leading to an \nincreased complexity of manufacturing systems and an increasingly \nrapid renewal of these systems. Consequently, upskilling employees’ \ncompetencies to handle and maintain the complex engineering assets \n(CEAs) is indispensable. In recent years, finding a skilled worker has \nbecome a difficult task. The reason is that there is a talent shortage \nnowadays. Indeed, in 2018, 45 % of employers said that they could not \nfind the necessary skills among candidates [17]. Furthermore, a new \nissue will arise from adapting to the changing job dynamics brought \nabout by digitalization [27]. Despite the increased interconnectedness \nand availability of information globally, the progress of digitalization \nhas not been uniformed across countries or even within industries within \nthe same country [14]. To face this challenge and meet with the adop­\ntion of Industry 4.0, employers need to find a new way to ensure their \nworkforces are sufficiently equipped to work with CEAs. In the aviation \nsector, research examined that traditional training such as in-class \ntraining and paper-based manual are not reliable means for teaching \njob tasks and the skills for visual inspection for the future trend in \naviation [11,29]. Visual inspection requires Aircraft Maintenance \nTechnician (AMT) to identify certain characteristics of all types of faults \nand make decision to troubleshoot various systems from one airplane to \nanother. Due to highly complexity and interrelated components in the \n* Corresponding author. \nE-mail address: j.a.erkoyuncu@cranfield.ac.uk (J.A.

Existing studies \nshowed that Augmented reality (AR)-based training could help to reduce \nlearning time, cognitive workload, and facilitate knowledge retention \n[12,16,4]. However, training effectiveness with AR could be decreased \nwhen the users fail to integrate training materials with their prior \nknowledge which could lead to poor knowledge retention and knowl­\nedge reusability [26]. During real maintenance, this situation could \nresult in prolonged asset downtime, an increase in cost and time asso­\nciated with a low first-time fix rate. Addressing this challenge entails a \nstrategy or a new paradigm to improve task learnability. \nCompact Oxford dictionary defines the term learnability as “the \ndegree to which knowledge or skill (in something) can be acquired \nthrough study or experience or by being taught”. In the field of cognitive \nscience, the ‘ACT-R′ (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) theory \ndistinguishes knowledge into declarative and procedural knowledge [2]. \nProcedural knowledge is acquired through practice and refers to infor­\nmation about how to perform a task and an action that can be directly \nexecuted. Declarative knowledge refers to facts and information which \ncannot be executed directly but can be applied for a specific goal that \ngoes through interpretative process. Complex industrial settings consist \nof tasks that can contain declarative and procedural knowledge such as \ndesign, diagnosis, assembly, management, repair, and training [10]. In \nnowadays, the way knowledge is acquired and how it is managed to \nfoster productivity have become an important key to achieving \ncompetitive advantages for organizations. In the organizational context, \nlearnability is defined as “a concept that captures the ability of em­\nployees to acquire the information and know-how necessary and suffi­\ncient to execute organizational practices” [21]. A weak learnability in an \norganization refers to a longer process, an extended effort, and a more \nfrequent exposure needed for the employees to acquire know-how in­\nformation necessary to perform their roles effectively [21]. This can lead \nto a high loss of time and a higher potential for errors which can affect \nproductivity. In general, learning can be evaluated by measuring how \nmuch information or know-how can be remembered (retention test) and \nbeing able to use the information to solve new problems (transfer test) \n[19]. This means that high learnability entails a high amount of infor­\nmation acquisition and high success on transfer problems. \nRecently, the introduction of Industry 5.0 has been viewed as a \nforward thinking of how new technologies embraced in Industry 4.0 can \nbe better developed to address the aspects of human-centric, sustain­\nability, and resilience [31]. In this paradigm, there is a growing demand \nfor the development of lifelong learning for workers whereby technol­\nogies are used to support one’s needs and interests to continuously up­\ndate his knowledge and skills in order to adapt to the changing \ncircumstances in the current industrial landscape brough about by the \ntechnology shift [3]. Therefore, increasing knowledge retention in long \nterm and knowledge reusability could serve as foundation for lifelong \nlearning which is to enable the ongoing learning and development \nthroughout an individual’s life. In this context, it is easy to see that there \nis a need to enhance the training approach to not only facilitate workers \nacquiring the necessary knowledge more efficiently but also to enable \nthem to retain and to reuse their training in different situations. \nAugmented Reality (AR) is one of the most promising technologies for \nIndustry 4.0. However, there is limited research that shows how AR is \ndeveloped to foster long life learning in the industrial context. This \npaper presents the enhanced development of information delivery using \nthis technology and shows the extent to which it could be used for \nknowledge transmission, more specifically on learnability, retention of \nknowledge over time, and reusability of knowledge compared to more \ncommon learning methods. The next section of this paper reviews \nexisting studies in the literature and presents research questions \naddressed in this study. Section 3 provides the methods used in this \nstudy followed by the results and analysis in the following Section. \nSection 5 discusses the findings of this work related with existing study \nand Section 6 provides conclusion and the future work. \n2. Related work \nOver the years, Augmented Reality (AR) has been investigated in \ndifferent applications to understand how it can facilitate learnability. \nEarly research of AR to assist assembly task found that the ability of AR \nto overlay graphical information on the task at hand to provide step by \nstep guidance on procedural knowledge and corrective instruction can \nincrease users’ perception and skills [25]. The increase in perception \nwas found to result in higher knowledge acquisition compared to \ntraditional method [25]. Recent study to provide distance learning also \nshowed that hybrid laboratory leveraging AR could improve knowledge \ntransfer of assembly task to the remote technician [22]. Moreover, AR \nhas also been shown to facilitate knowledge transfer of declarative \nknowledge (e.g., real-time monitoring of system’s performance) through \na cloud-enabled AR [28]. \nSimilarly, in the electronic assembly, AR was also found to increase \nknowledge retention of participants in a procedural task when specific \nfeedback was presented to correct the errors during learning and task \nexposure [30]. Furthermore, in comparison to different modes of in­\nformation delivery, AR users were able to recall more information from \nlong-term memory (e.g., seven day period) in the aviation/aerospace \ntraining, leading to a minimal amount of information loss [16]. More­\nover, AR was also tested in a simulated control room study to examine its \neffectiveness as an assistance system for procedural tasks. Compared to \ntraditional approaches, the users who used the AR-based assistance \nshowed fewer intra-team inquiry communication exchanges which in­\ndicates that AR was more effective in facilitating task comprehension or \nimplementation of a procedure [26]. Accordingly, some studies have \nattempted to push forward the intake of AR technologies for industrial \ntasks by developing an AR content authoring tool to support non-AR \nexperts [18]and AR collaboration tools to enable visual augmentation \nand effective annotation in 3D space[5]. \nThere are a couple of main reasons as to why AR can lead to better \nknowledge acquisition and retention compared to conventional ap­\nproaches. Firstly, learning contents presented in AR can enhance \nlearning motivation which involves attention, relevance, confidence, \nand satisfaction [13]. Motivation can help learners to engage, persist, \nand expand effort in the learning process which result in better learning \noutcomes than unmotivated learners [7]. Secondly, AR allows learning \ninformation to be presented in the 3D environment; in the appropriate \nplace and time, enabling learners to easily access the contextual infor­\nmation and avoid the excessive use of their cognitive resources. Since \nhumans have a limited working memory, the way cognitive resources \nare focused and used in learning can influence task performance [12]. \nThe efficient use of cognitive resources afforded by AR can lead to better \nknowledge comprehension and effective use of information to complete \na task [4]. All the previously existing studies have been focused solely on \nusing AR in presenting learning contents and assessing its effect on \nknowledge acquisition and retention. Nevertheless, there is currently no \nstudy that examines how AR can improve knowledge reusability, that is \nthe ability to use learned information to solve new problems. Further­\nmore, although some studies have explored the positive effect of AR \nfeedback to users while training, little is known as to how it is associated \nwith knowledge reusability. \nKnowledge reusability is an important aspect of learnability since the \nacquired knowledge provides the foundation for reasoning and actions \nwhen facing new but similar problems. Assessing the level of knowledge \nreusability can give insights into the effectiveness of learnability ob­\ntained from a learning media/approach to novel situations. One of the \ndetermining factors for human resources management to improve or­\nganization productivity lies in its ability to induce learning and exploit \nthe know-how information for various situations [21]. Developing a new \ntraining approach that encourages learning and enables knowledge \nreuse can take a company to achieve a new level of productivity. \nTherefore, this paper sought to examine two research questions that \nhave not been addressed in the literature: (1) how AR can be designed to \nD. Ariansyah et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n\nCIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology 48 (2024) 19–27\n21\npromote efficient knowledge comprehension and reusability and (2) \nhow does knowledge reusability relate to improved learnability. \n3. Methods \nIn the Cognitive theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), knowledge \nreuse is facilitated when learners engage in meaningful learning. \nMeaningful learning involves the learner making sense of the presented \ninformation by integrating the received information with the existing \nknowledge to form a coherent representation of new knowledge. Ac­\ncording to CTML, learners engage in three cognitive processes to expe­\nrience meaningful learning: selecting of relevant materials, organizing \nselected material by building structural relations among the elements, \nand integrating the selected material with the relevant prior existing \nknowledge [19]. Nevertheless, this does not mean that human minds can \nalways operate through all these processes when presented by infor­\nmation. Augmented Reality as a technology that can overlay augmented \ninformation in the real world has been shown to promote enhanced \nlearning achievement in the educational settings owing to its capabil­\nities provide immediate and relevant information [1]. In the industrial \nsetting, the augmented information that provides context to the real \nenvironment can ease the comprehension of the task and can reduce \nmental workload [12,23]. Table 1 outlines how AR can facilitate \nmeaningful learning. \nExisting studies using AR to support learning have been primarily \nfocused on presenting information in a passive way where the user is \npresented with information that allows him to complete the task. This \nkind of approach puts the user as a rather passive information receiver \nand might not be effective to achieve knowledge reusability [26]. In \nattempt to achieve meaningful learning, this study shows how AR was \ndeveloped to encourage thinking or sensemaking that allows user to \nbuild the mental model of the system. \n3.1. The design of enhanced AR-based information delivery \nTraditional AR system used in engineering training typically focused \non presenting training materials to help users go through a task/a pro­\ncess as clearly as possible with minimum error. However, the informa­\ntion is often isolated to a specific sub-task or a process which may not be \nsuitable for a complex system with highly interrelated components. \nComplex Engineering Assets (CEAs) constitute multiple layers of \ncomplexity (e.g. operational and task complexity) that are often chal­\nlenging for the user to deal with. Therefore, AR-based information needs \nto be enhanced in a way that facilitates learning to take place. To help \nusers with navigating the complexity and developing a mental model of \nthe system, one of the approaches could be to increase the transparency \nand the observability of the system behavior and functionality [8]. This \ncan be achieved by showing the information that the user is expected to \noperate and foresee. Providing such information can increase user \nawareness of the system, which can help users in combining newly \nperceived information with the user’s existing knowledge to form an \nupdated picture of changing situations [8]. Another thing that can \nreduce the potential for learning in a complex system is the excessive use \nof working memory resources due to the large amount of information to \nbe processed. Since human information processing system consists of \nmultiple channels in which each channel has a limited capacity to pro­\ncess information, multimodal information delivery has been suggested \nto facilitate information perception and understanding [19]. Based on \nthese theoretical constructs, three design principles were adopted to \ndevelop an enhanced AR-based information delivery system:  \n1. Multimodal information: combine visual information with vocal \nexplanation in the form of sound cues.  \n2. Contextual information: provide necessary information to prevent \nextraneous information processing. \n3. Projection of the given states: shows common mistakes and conse­\nquences for the projection of the given states. \n3.2. Development of augmented reality system \nThe AR system developed in this study was targeted on a head- \nmounted display Microsoft Hololens 2. It allows users to see their sur­\nrounding environment through transparent glasses while the holo­\ngraphic contents are projected onto these glasses and superimposed on \nthe real world. It is also equipped with multiple sensors such as depth \nsensor on the of the device, Inertia Measurement Unit (IMU) that mea­\nsures acceleration and rotation of the device in three dimensions, and \nfour visible cameras that are used in conjunction to accurately track \nuser’s hands in real-time. AR application was developed using Unity \nengine which supports multiple platforms for AR development. For AR \nlibrary, Vuforia engine was used for vision-based tracking. Vuforia has \nan augmented/mixed reality SDK that can be imported into Unity as a \nplugin. The user interface (UI) was developed using the Mixed Reality \nToolkit (MRTK) proposed by Microsoft specifically for use with Hol­\nolens2. The MRTK includes a range of features and tools that can help \ndevelopers with various aspects of mixed reality development, such as \nspatial mapping, hand tracking, gesture recognition, voice commands, \nand so on. \nTo enable AR for our experiment, an image that the Vuforia Engine \ncan identify, and track is used. This kind of image can be referred to as \nan “Image Target”. By comparing extracted natural characteristics from \nthe camera picture against a predefined target resource database, the \nVuforia Engine can identify and track the image, and can show \naugmented content on top of it. This solution was chosen as targeting \ndifferent components was difficult without their associated 3D model \nwhich needs to be created for that purpose. Moreover, small objects such \nas wires are difficult to track due to their size. System architecture of the \nAR system is presented in Fig. 1. \n3.3. Experimental validation \n3.3.1. Experimental conditions \nTo simulate an industrial scenario that is complex enough to test \ndifferent methods of learning, an electronic wiring task was defined. \nThis scenario was motivated by several reasons: it can be easily \nrepeated, and the complexity of an electronic task is quite high if the \nuser has no previous knowledge about this field. Furthermore, as an \nelectronic wiring task must be done precisely and consist of multiple \nvariations to achieve the objective, the selected task is suitable for the \nevaluation of retention and transfer test. The task contained five \nfollowing subtasks:  \n– Wire a power supply.  \n– Connect the power supply to a voltage regulator board.  \n– Connect the voltage regulator board to a terminal block.  \n– Connect a sensor to the terminal block.  \n– Connect an Arduino board to the installation through a breadboard. \nTable 1 \nHow AR can facilitate meaningful learning.  \nCognitive \nprocess \nHow AR can facilitate \nSelecting  \n– Minimizing extraneous information by overlaying only relevant \ninformation in the real environment (i.e. considering contextual \nrelevance including users, task, equipment, workplace, etc. [32, \n6,9])  \n– Displaying additional information to user based on on-demand \nrequest \nOrganizing  \n– Showing a step-by-step information to complete a task.  \n– Combine the presented information dynamically in real-time \nIntegrating  \n– Displaying supplementing multimodal information  \n– Adding contextual information to enhance task awareness  \nD. Ariansyah et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n\nCIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology 48 (2024) 19–27\n22\nFurther, the task was tested under three different learning interfaces: \n(1) a paper-based document that serves as a control group against AR \nsystems, (2) a traditional AR-based training system, and (3) an enhanced \nAR-based training system that was developed by applying design prin­\nciples that encourage meaningful learning. \n3.3.1.1. The paper-based document. The paper-based document (see: \n10.17862/cranfield.rd.24079371) contains all information about the \nelectronic system and its components. It also consists of a step-by-step \ninformation in the form of textual instruction and pictures to complete \na wiring task. \n3.3.1.2. The traditional AR-based training system. This training system \nreplicated most of AR systems used for learning the assembly tasks \nwhich include textual information, graphical objects (e.g. arrow) for \npointing certain objects, and videos. Users were initially presented with \nan overview of the electronic system and its all components using \ntooltips and graphical arrows (See Fig. 2(a)). To acquire skills in wiring \nthe system, assembly instructions were presented step by step on top of \nthe workspace in the form of texts as well as videos which describe the \ntask and how to do it (See Fig. 2(b)). The users can pause and play the \nvideo as much as they like and proceed to the next step. \n3.3.1.3. The enhanced AR-based training system. The enhanced AR- \nbased training system was similar to the traditional one regarding the \ncontents. However, it had voice cues (multimodal information) that \ngives additional context and information to the user. For example, \nduring the unscrewing part of the power supply, the voice cue gives \nadditional information on how to perform the task: “To loosen the \nscrews, do two or three counterclockwise turns with the screwdriver on \nboth screws”. It also included common mistakes and consequences panel \nafter each step to enable the user to grasp the significance of their \nactions and increase the understanding of the system behavior (projec­\ntion of the given states and their consequences) as shown in Fig. 3. \n3.3.2. Experimental procedure \nTo examine how different methods of learning affect users in un­\nderstanding the task and reusing the acquired knowledge to a different \nsituation, this study assessed independent groups of users (between- \nsubjects test) who were assigned to each learning method to learn the \nsame task. Each participant was asked to fill out a demographic ques­\ntionnaire (see: 10.17862/cranfield.rd.24079371) which includes elec­\ntronical and augmented reality background questionnaire to check \nwhether they had done some tasks related electronics system and if they \nwere familiar with the use of AR prior to the experiment. After that, each \nparticipant was given a questionnaire with questions related to the \nstudied wiring task to test their initial knowledge about the system. \nThe test consisted of questions about the identification of different \ncomponents they would use during the task and about general knowl­\nedge given during the experiment. Following this, a total of thirteen \nparticipants were involved in this experiment where four people were \nassigned in traditional AR group, five people in the enhanced AR group, \nand four people in the paper-based document group. They were all \nstudents (Male = 6, Female = 7) and aged between 25 and 35 years old. \nTheir knowledge about electronics was balanced across the groups (See \nSection 4.1). The test was graded over 11 questions and was also given \nafter they finished the task to measure the amount of information they \nlearned after going through a training (short term retention test). One \nweek later, each participant was assessed again with the same ques­\ntionnaire to test their capability to remember what they learned (long \nterm retention test). The duration of a week has been used in many \nstudies for memory retention test [16,26]. Furthermore, participants \nwere not told that the questionnaire would be the same after one week. \nExisting studies that measured task learnability typically focused on \nFig. 1. System architecture of AR system.  \nFig. 2. Traditional AR-based training system: (a) the overview of the electronic wiring system, (b) assembly instructions in the textual form and video.  \nD. Ariansyah et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n\nCIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology 48 (2024) 19–27\n23\ntesting declarative knowledge of a task through questionnaires or pro­\ncedural knowledge through executing the task without assistance. In \naddition, objective assessments measuring time completion and the \nnumber of mistakes were also administered to measure how well they \nunderstand the learning contents. Unlike the previous studies, in this \nstudy participants were also asked to wire a second sensor to a terminal \nboard without any guidance. To complete this task successfully, the \nparticipant must have the right understanding of the electronic system \nto identify the correct connection to the power source. Since there was \nno existing connection present, they had to improvise by creating a new \nconnection. This test was used to assess knowledge reusability. \n3.3.3. Data analysis \nTo analyze the effect of different learning methods to learnability, \nthis study examined the score of each question in the pre-test to test the \ninitial knowledge across different groups. The same analysis was also \ncarried out in the post-tests for short- and long-term retention tests. The \nscore for each question was normalized with respect to the number of \nparticipants and one way ANOVA was run to test if there were statisti­\ncally significant differences among the means of the groups. It helps \nidentify if there are significant differences among the groups and pro­\nvides insights into which groups may differ from each other. Addition­\nally, one-way repeated measure ANOVA was run to examine if there \nwere statistically significant difference among the means of test score for \npre-test, short- and long-term test. Furthermore, one way ANOVA was \nrun to assess the effect on the task performance such as completion time, \nnumber of mistakes, and knowledge reusability. Finally, Point-Biserial \nand Pearson’s correlation were run to examine the relation between \nknowledge retention and knowledge reusability as well as short- and \nlong-term retention respectively. Statistical analysis was run by SPSS \nv29 with statistical significance was determined when p < 0.05. \n4. Results \n4.1. Participants’ data \nTable 2 presents a snapshot of participant demographics, occupation, \nnationality, and assessment responses. It shows almost all participants \nhad no experience in performing electronic-related and wiring task (Q5 \nand Q6) and only one participant had done electronic task related. The \nwere more participants who had used AR (Q7) but rarely (Q8) and \nmostly for educational purposes (Q9). Only two participants preferred \nself-learning than with instructor (Q10). Overall, the participants in this \nstudy were homogeneous in terms of age, occupation, and their \nknowledge of electronic-related task. \n4.2. Learnability pre-test \nTable 2 shows the result of pre-test for three groups of participants to \nassess their knowledge in the electronic task. As can been seen, the \npercentage of right answers from three groups were in a range from \n12.73 % to 15.91 % and there were no statistical significant differences \nbetween groups as determined by one-way ANOVA (F(2,30) = 0.124, \np = 0.884) indicating that all participants in all groups were not familiar \nwith the given electronic task. From this result, the baseline knowledge \nabout electronic in all groups was balanced and the subsequent result in \nthe post-test can be reliably compared as a certain extent participants \nacquire new knowledge after participating in the training. \n4.3. Learnability post-test (short-term retention) \nTable 3 shows the score of the post-test from three different groups \nusing different modes of training for electronics training. The results \nindicated that AR-based approaches could enhance knowledge acquisi­\ntion to over 20 % for traditional AR and almost 25% for enhanced AR as \ncompared to traditional paper-based approach.

Learnability post-test (long-term retention) \nThe result of the post-test after one week from the experiment across \ndifferent groups was shown on the Table 4. While, the paper-based \ngroup seems to relatively retain the knowledge they learned after one \nweek, there was a slight decrease observed in the total number of correct \nanswers for traditional AR group whereas a small increment of the total \nof correct answer was observed for enhanced AR group. In this post-test \nanalysis, there was a statistically significant difference between groups \nas examined by one-way ANOVA (F(2,30) = 5.150, p = 0.012). A Tukey \npost hoc test analysis revealed that the score of post-test for the \nenhanced AR group was statistically significant from the paper-based \nmanual group (p = 0.009) whereas there were no statistically signifi­\ncant difference between traditional and enhanced group (p = 0.241) \nand between traditional and paper-based group (p = 0.278). \n4.5. Short- and long-term retention comparison \nFurther analysis was carried out to assess the differences in the \nknowledge retention between short- and long-term test across the \ngroups relative to the baseline (i.e. learnability pre-test). As indicated on \nthe Table 5, each training methods led to statistically significant \nimprovement of correct answers compared to pre-test as determined by \none-way repeated measure ANOVA whereas there were no statistically \nsignificant differences in knowledge retention test between long- and \nshort-term across all groups. \n4.6. Task performance \nThe task performance in terms of completion time and the number of \nerrors were compared across three different experimental settings. Fig. 4 \nshows that the traditional AR led to the shortest mean completion time \nwith 30 s and more than 70 s compared to the enhanced AR and paper- \nbased document respectively. It also shows that the traditional AR had \nthe highest variability of task completion whereas the lowest variability \nwas observed in the paper-based group. One-way ANOVA determined \nthere were no statistically significant differences among all group in \nterms of mean task completion time (F(2,10) = 0.176, p = 0.841) and \nmean number of overall errors (F(2,10) = 0.497, p = 0.623). \n4.7. Knowledge reusability test \nFig. 5 presents the percentage of participants who could reuse the \nknowledge acquired and apply it to different situation. Almost all par­\nticipants (4 out of 5) in the enhanced AR group could successfully apply \nthe knowledge correctly. However, there were only 50% (two out of \nfour) and 25 % (one out of four) in traditional AR and paper-based group \nrespectively who could reuse the knowledge successfully. One way \nANOVA determined that the differences were not statistically significant \nTable 3 \nScores of pre-test for learnability questionnaire.  \nQuestion # \nCorrect answer \nTraditional AR \ngroup (4 people) \nEnhanced AR \ngroup (5 \npeople) \nPaper-based \nmanual group (4 \npeople) \n1: Power supply  \n0  \n2  \n0 \n2: Terminal block  \n1  \n2  \n1 \n3: Arduino board  \n1  \n0  \n1 \n4: Breadboard  \n2  \n1  \n1 \n5: Voltage regulator \nboard  \n0  \n0  \n1 \n6: Sensor  \n1  \n0  \n0 \n7: 24–9 V \nconnection  \n0  \n1  \n0 \n8: Proximity sensor \nwire colors  \n0  \n1  \n1 \n9: Voltage regulator \nboard terminal \nwiring  \n1  \n0  \n0 \n10: Power supply \noutput voltage \nwiring  \n0  \n0  \n1 \n11: Wire color \nswitching  \n1  \n0  \n0 \nTotal of correct \nanswers  \n7  \n7  \n6 \nTotal of incorrect \nanswers  \n37  \n48  \n38 \nPercentage of right \nanswers  \n15.91 %  \n12.73 %  \n13.64 %  \nTable 4 \nScores of post-test for learnability questionnaire (short-term retention).  \nQuestion # \nCorrect answer \nTraditional AR \ngroup (4 people) \nEnhanced AR \ngroup (5 \npeople) \nPaper-based \nmanual group (4 \npeople) \n1: Power supply  \n4  \n4  \n4 \n2: Terminal block  \n4  \n5  \n3 \n3: Arduino board  \n4  \n5  \n3 \n4: Breadboard  \n3  \n5  \n3 \n5: Voltage regulator \nboard  \n4  \n4  \n2 \n6: Sensor  \n4  \n5  \n4 \n7: 24–9 V \nconnection  \n4  \n4  \n2 \n8: Proximity sensor \nwire colors  \n1  \n3  \n1 \n9: Voltage regulator \nboard terminal \nwiring  \n2  \n3  \n1 \n10: Power supply \noutput voltage \nwiring  \n1  \n3  \n0 \n11: Wire color \nswitching  \n3  \n3  \n2 \nTotal of correct \nanswers  \n34  \n44  \n25 \nTotal of incorrect \nanswers  \n10  \n11  \n19 \nPercentage of right \nanswers  \n77.27 %  \n80.00 %  \n56.82 %  \nTable 5 \nScores of post-test for learnability questionnaire (one week after).  \nQuestion # \nCorrect answer \nTraditional AR \ngroup \n(4 People) \nEnhanced AR \ngroup \n(5 People) \nPaper-based \nmanual group \n(4 People) \n1: Power supply  \n3  \n4  \n4 \n2: Terminal block  \n4  \n4  \n1 \n3: Arduino board  \n4  \n5  \n3 \n4: Breadboard  \n3  \n5  \n3 \n5: Voltage regulator \nboard  \n2  \n4  \n2 \n6: Sensor  \n3  \n5  \n2 \n7: 24–9 V connection  \n2  \n5  \n2 \n8: Proximity sensor wire \ncolors  \n2  \n5  \n1 \n9: Voltage regulator \nboard terminal wiring  \n3  \n3  \n1 \n10: Power supply output \nvoltage wiring  \n1  \n3  \n1 \n11: Wire color switching  \n4  \n5  \n4 \nTotal of correct answers  \n31  \n48  \n24 \nTotal of incorrect \nanswers  \n13  \n7  \n20 \nPercentage of right \nanswers  \n70.45 %  \n87.27 %  \n54.55  \nD.

Discussion \nMany applications have shown that AR technology can improve \nlearnability when acquiring new skills or concepts over traditional \ntraining in terms of knowledge comprehension rate and knowledge \nretention. The superiority of AR lies in its capability to overlay inter­\nactive and animated information in a timely manner. This helps to in­\ncrease user’s motivation to engage with the content which is essential to \nencourage learning. Besides, allowing users to see the necessary infor­\nmation at a favorable time results in a more efficient use of cognitive \nresources and in turn accommodates more learning. Nevertheless, the \ncurrent paradigm in using AR for training seems to focus on a limited \naspect of productivity such as task performance and knowledge reten­\ntion enablement. In the light of Industry 5.0 which emphasizes on \nhuman centric, sustainability, and resilience, technology is expected to \nbe developed in ways that serve human needs for upskilling or reskilling, \nwith efficient use of resources, and better equip human to deal with \nuncertainties [15,31]. In attempt to expand the knowledge in this area, \nthis study sought to base the development of AR system for training on \nhuman centric principles to facilitate meaningful learning and achieve \nimproved learnability in terms of retention test and transfer test (see. \nTable 7). \nThe results in the retention test showed that all users demonstrated \nstatistically significant understanding in the given task regardless of \nwhich training system (see Table 5). However, users in the AR groups \nwere able to get an overall higher number of correct answers (18% for \nthe traditional and ~25 % for the enhanced) than paper-based manual \ndespite completion time and number of mistakes committed were \nsimilar across groups. Although the differences were not significant in \nthe short-term test, the higher scores observed in AR groups could be due \nto more extraneous processing occurred in the paper-based manual \ngroup whereas more essential processing occurred in the AR groups. \nEssential processing involves intrinsic load or essential material/ \nFig. 4.

In line with this, several studies [4, \n12] also argued that AR learning could save users from some cognitive \nprocessing necessary to search and select the essential information to be \nlearned which could provide the reason why AR could lead to higher \nknowledge acquisition score than traditional training method. When \nusing traditional approach like paper-based manual, users need to scan \nall information before deciding which section that is essential and \nrelevant to the completion of the task. This imposes more workload to \nthe user. In contrast, AR presents curated information and release users \nfrom searching task so that they can focus on interpreting the presented \ninformation. Besides, it is also important to note that embedding added \ncontextual information in the enhanced AR training environment such \nas sound cues and projection of condition-consequence states may in­\ncrease the learning time compared to typical AR that presents unimodal \nand decontextualized information. This is to be expected since users \nneed to attend to more information. However, they are more likely to \nacquire more knowledge because the additional information enhances \nknowledge formulation and facilitates better integration with the users’ \nprior knowledge. One study has also observed similar findings whereby \nenabling AR system to identify user’s mistake and suggest correction to \nusers while training can improve learning test score as opposed to \ntraditional AR tutor [30]. Nevertheless, since no assessment was made \non long term retention and knowledge reusability, little is known \nwhether such feedback is effective to achieve meaningful learning. \nIn terms of long-term retention test, there were no statistically sig­\nnificant differences between short- and long-term retention test for all \ngroups which might suggest that all training systems tested in this study \nseemed to work effectively in helping users to remember what they had \nlearned. In other words, users who performed well in acquiring the \nknowledge (short-term retention) were associated with having the \nability to retain the acquired knowledge a week after (long-term \nretention). However, when inter-group training systems were compared, \nthe enhanced AR training led to better knowledge retention score than \nthe paper-based group as indicated by a statistically significant differ­\nence in their mean scores. This might suggest that the knowledge gap \nbecame wider between the paper-based and the enhanced AR group a \nweek after. Similar findings were also observed when comparing AR \nlearning method with a video and a paper-based presentation in which \nafter seven days, the amount of information loss was significant for \ntraditional training but not for AR [16]. On the contrary, one study \nfound that AR training led to worse memory retention compared to other \ntraditional approaches (e.g. paper-based document) [26]. While it is \ndifficult to pinpoint the underlying factors responsible for the discrep­\nancies observed across studies as memory retention can be influenced by \nmany factors (e.g. individual differences, content and task requirement, \netc.) [20], helping users building a strong association between the task \nand information seems to play an important role for learning to take \nplace. \nIn this study, users in the enhanced AR group performed better in \nknowledge acquisition and long-term retention than users in paper- \nbased group could be influenced by the sensemaking task involved in \nthe enhanced AR group. The transparency of the system behavior was \nincreased through the projection of given states and their consequences \nwhich encourage users to think and make sense of presented informa­\ntion. Think more deeply of relevant information leaves more memory \ntraces which enables them to retain the information [26]. In the CTML, \nwhen relevant information was selected and integrated with the prior \nknowledge, the information learned is moved from working memory to \nlong term memory for future information retrieval [20]. This might \nexplain why traditional AR systems in which users were conditioned as \nsolely information receiver and implementer might not be able to retain \nthe information effectively [26]. Furthermore, users in AR groups \nseemed to more likely succeeding in applying the knowledge acquired to \na new situation (i.e., transfer test). This was also indicated by a positive \ncorrelation between short-term retention and transfer test which sug­\ngests that users who scored high in knowledge acquisition test imme­\ndiately after the training was related with being able to successfully \nreuse their knowledge. \nFinally, it seems that applying human-centric design principles such \nas providing contextual information in multimodal form facilitates users \nin attending the relevant and essential information while increasing \nsystem transparency encourages thinking and sensemaking of the pre­\nsented information. This had shown a positive impact in achieving \nmeaningful learning whereby users were more able to recall the lesson \nlearnt and reuse it in different settings without going through explicit \ntraining. Addressing the adoption of new technologies that are focused \non human-centric approach rather than their capabilities is a crucial \nfactor. To align with Industry 5.0 core value that emphasizes human and \nsocietal goal in technology intake, knowledge reusability plays a vital \nrole in enabling employee’s empowerment, promoting collaboration, \nand adaptability, as well as fostering long life learning. This paper \npresents a new approach in adopting AR technology that looks at aspects \nof productivity beyond task performance and knowledge retention. \nMore research is required to expand the integration of new technologies \nand people which are built to serve humans and fit the needs and di­\nversity of industrial workers. This study is limited in terms of number of \npeople who participated as well as the case for knowledge reusability \ntests. However, it has shown that applying human-centric design prin­\nciples in the technology development can better accommodate human \nneeds for training in developing their own skills and grow in their roles, \nwhich aligns with Industry 5.0’s human-centric approach of valuing, \nempowering, and engaging the workforce [15]. \n6. Conclusion and further research \nIn the face of the current industrial landscape, which is described as \ndynamic and fast-paced as it is constantly evolving due to advancements \nin technologies, industries are implementing various strategies to in­\ncrease the productivity of their workforce. Nevertheless, the adoption of \nnew technologies should not be focused solely to drive higher task \nperformance but rather to promote the development of lifelong learning \nof the workers to enable them to grow their knowledge and skills. In this \nstudy, we demonstrated the improvement of knowledge acquisition and \nreusability by applying human-centric design principles over traditional \ntraining which addresses two previously presented research questions. \nFirstly, regarding how AR can be designed to promote efficient knowl­\nedge comprehension and reusability, the results of this study showed \nthat providing additional context in the form of voice cue to complement \nvisual information could aid users in avoiding extraneous information \nprocessing and to attend to essential information. This could lead to \nincreased knowledge comprehension which was indicated by a higher \nnumber of correct answers in the use case. In addition, improving system \ntransparency to the users encourages sensemaking of presented infor­\nmation which may increase the success of knowledge transfer to a new \nsituation. Secondly, this study found that knowledge reusability had a \npositive correlation with short-term knowledge retention test scores. \nThis relation is consistent with the expectation that when the more \nTable 7 \nRelation between knowledge retention and knowledge reusability.   \nKnowledge \nreusability \nShort-term \nretention \nLong-term \nretention \nKnowledge \nreusability  \n1 \n0.672 * \n0.466 \nShort-term \nretention   \n1 \n0.717 * * \nLong-term \nretention    \n1 \n*p < 0.05 \n* *p < 0.01 \nD.
